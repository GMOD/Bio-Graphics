This glyph draws signal graph (wiggle_xyplot) using wiggle or BigWig files
requires a special load gff file that uses attributes 'wigfileA' and 'wigfileB'
For BigWig support it is also required to have 'fasta' attribute set to point
to a fasta file for your organism of interest

Example:

2L  test   hybrid    5407   23011573    .     .     .     Name=Experiment 1;wigfileA=SomeWigFile1.wigdb;wigfileB=SomeWigFile2.wigdb

=head1 NAME


Bio::Graphics::Glyph::hybrid_plot - An xyplot plot drawing dual graph using data from two wiggle files per track

=head1 SYNOPSIS


See <Bio::Graphics::Panel> <Bio::Graphics::Glyph> and <Bio::Graphics::Glyph::wiggle_xyplot>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION


Note that for full functionality this glyph requires Bio::Graphics::Glyph::generic (generic glyph is used for drawing individual
matches for small RNA alignments at a high zoom level, specified by semantic zooming in GBrowse conf file)
Unlike the regular xyplot, this glyph draws two overlapping graphs
using value data in Bio::Graphics::Wiggle file format:

track type=wiggle_0 name="Experiment" description="snRNA seq data" visibility=pack viewLimits=-2:2 color=255,0,0 altColor=0,0,255 windowingFunction=mean smoothingWindow=16
 
 2L 400 500 0.5
 2L 501 600 0.5
 2L 601 700 0.4
 2L 701 800 0.1
 2L 800 900 0.1
  
##gff-version 3

2L      Sample_rnaseq  rnaseq_wiggle 41   3009 . . . ID=Samlpe_2L;Name=Sample;Note=YourNoteHere;wigfileA=/datadir/track_001.2L.wig;wigfileB=/datadir/track_002.2L.wig
  

The "wigfileA" and "wigfileB" attributes give a relative or absolute pathname to 
Bio::Graphics::Wiggle format files for two concurrent sets of data. Basically,
these wigfiles contain the data on signal intensity (counts) for sequences 
aligned with genomic regions. In wigfileA these data are additive, so for each
sequence region the signal is calculated as a sum of signals from overlapping
matches (signal). In wigfileB the signal represents the maximum value among all 
sequences (signal quality) aligned with the current region so the user can see
the difference between accumulated signal from overlapping multiple matches 
(which may likely be just a noise from products of degradation) and high-quality 
signal from unique sequences.
 
It is essential that wigfile entries in gff file do not have score, because
score used to differentiate between data for dual graph and data for matches
(individual features visible at higher magnification). After an update to
wiggle_xyplot code colors for dual plot are now hard-coded (blue for signal and
orange for signal quality). Alpha channel is also handled by wiggle_xyplot code now.

=head2 OPTIONS

In addition to some of the wiggle_xyplot glyph options, the following options are
recognized:

 Name        Value        Description
 ----        -----        -----------

 wigfileA    path name    Path to a Bio::Graphics::Wiggle file for accumulated vales in 10-base bins

 wigfileB    path name    Path to a Bio::Graphics::Wiggle file for max values in 10-base bins

 fasta       path name    Path to fasta file to enable BigWig drawing

 u_method    method name  Use method of [method name] to identify individual features (like alignment matches) 
                          to show at high zoom level. By default it is set to 'match'
