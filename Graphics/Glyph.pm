=head1 NAME

Bio::Graphics::Glyph - Base class for Bio::Graphics::Glyph objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Bio::Graphics::Panel>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bio::Graphics::Glyph is the base class for all glyph objects.  Each
glyph is a wrapper around an Bio:SeqFeatureI object, knows how to
render itself on an Bio::Graphics::Panel, and has a variety of
configuration variables.

End developers will not ordinarily work directly with
Bio::Graphics::Glyph objects, but with Bio::Graphics::Glyph::generic
and its subclasses.  Similarly, most glyph developers will want to
subclass from Bio::Graphics::Glyph::generic because the latter
provides labeling and arrow-drawing facilities.

=head1 METHODS

This section describes the class and object methods for
Bio::Graphics::Glyph.

=head2 CONSTRUCTORS

Bio::Graphics::Glyph objects are constructed automatically by an
Bio::Graphics::Glyph::Factory, and are not usually created by
end-developer code.

=over 4

=item $glyph = Bio::Graphics::Glyph-E<gt>new(-feature=E<gt>$feature,-factory=E<gt>$factory)

Given a sequence feature, creates an Bio::Graphics::Glyph object to
display it.  The B<-feature> argument points to the Bio:SeqFeatureI
object to display, and B<-factory> indicates an
Bio::Graphics::Glyph::Factory object from which the glyph will fetch
all its run-time configuration information.  Factories are created and
manipulated by the Bio::Graphics::Panel object.

A standard set of options are recognized.  See L<OPTIONS>.

=back

=head2 OBJECT METHODS

Once a glyph is created, it responds to a large number of methods.  In
this section, these methods are grouped into related categories.

Retrieving glyph context:

=over 4

=item $factory = $glyph-E<gt>factory

Get the Bio::Graphics::Glyph::Factory associated with this object.
This cannot be changed once it is set.

=item $panel = $glyph-E<gt>panel

Get the Bio::Graphics::Panel associated with this object.  This cannot
be changed once it is set.

=item $feature = $glyph-E<gt>feature

Get the sequence feature associated with this object.  This cannot be
changed once it is set.

=item $feature = $glyph-E<gt>add_feature(@features)

Add the list of features to the glyph, creating subparts.  This is
most common done with the track glyph returned by
Ace::Graphics::Panel-E<gt>add_track().

=item $feature = $glyph-E<gt>add_group(@features)

This is similar to add_feature(), but the list of features is treated
as a group and can be configured as a set.

=back

Retrieving glyph options:

=over 4

=item $fgcolor = $glyph-E<gt>fgcolor

=item $bgcolor = $glyph-E<gt>bgcolor

=item $fontcolor = $glyph-E<gt>fontcolor

=item $fontcolor = $glyph-E<gt>font2color

=item $fillcolor = $glyph-E<gt>fillcolor

These methods return the configured foreground, background, font,
alternative font, and fill colors for the glyph in the form of a
GD::Image color index.

=item $color = $glyph-E<gt>tkcolor

This method returns a color to be used to flood-fill the entire glyph
before drawing (currently used by the "track" glyph).

=item $width = $glyph-E<gt>width([$newwidth])

Return the width of the glyph, not including left or right padding.
This is ordinarily set internally based on the size of the feature and
the scale of the panel.

=item $width = $glyph-E<gt>layout_width

Returns the width of the glyph including left and right padding.

=item $width = $glyph-E<gt>height

Returns the height of the glyph, not including the top or bottom
padding.  This is calculated from the "height" option and cannot be
changed.


=item $font = $glyph-E<gt>font

Return the font for the glyph.

=item $option = $glyph-E<gt>option($option)

Return the value of the indicated option.

=item $index = $glyph-E<gt>color($color)

Given a symbolic or #RRGGBB-form color name, returns its GD index.

=item $level = $glyph-E<gt>level

The "level" is the nesting level of the glyph.
Groups are level -1, top level glyphs are level 0,
subparts (e.g. exons) are level 1 and so forth.

=back

Setting an option:

=over 4

=item $glyph-E<gt>configure(-name=E<gt>$value)

You may change a glyph option after it is created using set_option().
This is most commonly used to configure track glyphs.

=back

Retrieving information about the sequence:

=over 4

=item $start = $glyph-E<gt>start

=item $end   = $glyph-E<gt>end

These methods return the start and end of the glyph in base pair
units.

=item $offset = $glyph-E<gt>offset

Returns the offset of the segment (the base pair at the far left of
the image).

=item $length = $glyph-E<gt>length

Returns the length of the sequence segment.

=back


Retrieving formatting information:

=over 4

=item $top = $glyph-E<gt>top

=item $left = $glyph-E<gt>left

=item $bottom = $glyph-E<gt>bottom

=item $right = $glyph-E<gt>right

These methods return the top, left, bottom and right of the glyph in
pixel coordinates.

=item $height = $glyph-E<gt>height

Returns the height of the glyph.  This may be somewhat larger or
smaller than the height suggested by the GlyphFactory, depending on
the type of the glyph.

=item $scale = $glyph-E<gt>scale

Get the scale for the glyph in pixels/bp.

=item $height = $glyph-E<gt>labelheight

Return the height of the label, if any.

=item $label = $glyph-E<gt>label

Return a human-readable label for the glyph.

=back

These methods are called by Bio::Graphics::Track during the layout
process:

=over 4

=item $glyph-E<gt>move($dx,$dy)

Move the glyph in pixel coordinates by the indicated delta-x and
delta-y values.

=item ($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2) = $glyph-E<gt>box

Return the current position of the glyph.

=back

These methods are intended to be overridden in subclasses:

=over 4

=item $glyph-E<gt>calculate_height

Calculate the height of the glyph.

=item $glyph-E<gt>calculate_left

Calculate the left side of the glyph.

=item $glyph-E<gt>calculate_right

Calculate the right side of the glyph.

=item $glyph-E<gt>draw($gd,$left,$top)

Optionally offset the glyph by the indicated amount and draw it onto
the GD::Image object.


=item $glyph-E<gt>draw_label($gd,$left,$top)

Draw the label for the glyph onto the provided GD::Image object,
optionally offsetting by the amounts indicated in $left and $right.

=back

These methods are useful utility routines:

=over 4

=item $pixels = $glyph-E<gt>map_pt($bases);

Map the indicated base position, given in base pair units, into
pixels, using the current scale and glyph position.

=item $glyph-E<gt>filled_box($gd,$x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)

Draw a filled rectangle with the appropriate foreground and fill
colors, and pen width onto the GD::Image object given by $gd, using
the provided rectangle coordinates.

=item $glyph-E<gt>filled_oval($gd,$x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)

As above, but draws an oval inscribed on the rectangle.

=back

=head2 OPTIONS

The following options are standard among all Glyphs.  See individual
glyph pages for more options.

  Option      Description                      Default
  ------      -----------                      -------

  -fgcolor      Foreground color	       black

  -outlinecolor	Synonym for -fgcolor

  -bgcolor      Background color               turquoise

  -fillcolor    Synonym for -bgcolor

  -linewidth    Line width                     1

  -height       Height of glyph		       10

  -font         Glyph font		       gdSmallFont

  -connector    Connector type                 0 (false)

  -connector_color
                Connector color                black

  -strand_arrow Whether to indicate            0 (false)
                 strandedness

  -label        Whether to draw a label	       0 (false)

  -description  Whether to draw a description  0 (false)

For glyphs that consist of multiple segments, the -connector option
controls what's drawn between the segments.  The default is 0 (no
connector).  Options include "hat", an upward-angling conector,
"solid", a straight horizontal connector, and "dashed", for a
horizontal dashed line.  The -connector_color option controls the
color of the connector, if any.

The label is printed above the glyph.  You may pass an anonymous
subroutine to -label, in which case the subroutine will be invoked
with the feature as its single argument.  The subroutine must return a
string to render as the label.  Otherwise, you may return the number
"1", in which case the feature's info(), seqname() and primary_tag()
methods will be called (in that order) until a suitable name is found.

The description is printed below the glyph.  You may pass an anonymous
subroutine to -label, in which case the subroutine will be invoked
with the feature as its single argument.  The subroutine must return a
string to render as the label.  Otherwise, you may return the number
"1", in which case the feature's source_tag() method will be invoked.

In the case of ACEDB Ace::Sequence feature objects, the feature's
info(), Brief_identification() and Locus() methods will be called to
create a suitable description.

The -strand_arrow option, if true, requests that the glyph indicate
which strand it is on, usually by drawing an arrowhead.  Not all
glyphs can respond appropriately to this request.

=head1 SUBCLASSING Bio::Graphics::Glyph

By convention, subclasses are all lower-case.  Begin each subclass
with a preamble like this one:

 package Bio::Graphics::Glyph::crossbox;

 use strict;
 use vars '@ISA';
 @ISA = 'Bio::Graphics::Glyph';

Then override the methods you need to.  Typically, just the draw()
method will need to be overridden.  However, if you need additional
room in the glyph, you may override calculate_height(),
calculate_left() and calculate_right().  Do not directly override
height(), left() and right(), as their purpose is to cache the values
returned by their calculating cousins in order to avoid time-consuming
recalculation.

A simple draw() method looks like this:

 sub draw {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->SUPER::draw(@_);
  my $gd = shift;

  # and draw a cross through the box
  my ($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2) = $self->calculate_boundaries(@_);
  my $fg = $self->fgcolor;
  $gd->line($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$fg);
  $gd->line($x1,$y2,$x2,$y1,$fg);
 }

This subclass draws a simple box with two lines criss-crossed through
it.  We first call our inherited draw() method to generate the filled
box and label.  We then call calculate_boundaries() to return the
coordinates of the glyph, disregarding any extra space taken by
labels.  We call fgcolor() to return the desired foreground color, and
then call $gd-E<gt>line() twice to generate the criss-cross.

For more complex draw() methods, see Bio::Graphics::Glyph::transcript
and Bio::Graphics::Glyph::segments.
