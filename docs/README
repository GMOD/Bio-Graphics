To build the HTML documentation,  go into the top level of the Bio::Graphics
distribution and type ./make_docs.pl

This will create a set of .shtml files based on the POD documentation contained
in the modules.  You might find it easier to read the POD documentation directly.
For example:

   perldoc Bio::Graphics::Panel
